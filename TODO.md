# TODO: Make Website More Responsive and Mobile-Friendly

- [x] Enhance CSS media queries: Add a new breakpoint at 480px for very small screens (e.g., phones), and refine existing ones (768px, 640px) for better transitions.
- [x] Hero section: Reduce font sizes, adjust padding and margins for tighter spacing on mobile, ensure text wraps properly.
- [x] Sports section: Adjust grid gap, card padding, and image heights for better stacking and readability on small screens.
- [x] Schedule section: Improve table cell padding, font sizes, and ensure the table remains scrollable with better touch interaction.
- [x] Contact section: Ensure form and info stack vertically on all small screens, increase form control heights for touch-friendliness.
- [x] Footer: Adjust grid to stack sections earlier (e.g., at 768px), reduce padding for compact layout.
- [x] General improvements: Increase button sizes and touch targets, adjust container padding across breakpoints, ensure images (like logo) scale properly.
