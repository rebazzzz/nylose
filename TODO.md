# TODO for Registration Page Fixes

- [x] Add top margin to .registration in styles/registration.css to fix navbar overlap
- [x] Update registration.html form to include required fields: separate first and last name, personnummer, address
- [x] Add parent fields for minors in registration.html (hidden by default)
- [x] Update js/scripts.js to show/hide parent fields based on personnummer (YYYYMMDD-XXXX) and set required for minors
- [x] Add placeholder to personnummer input and hide it on input
